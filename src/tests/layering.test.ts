/**
 * The layering contract: `core/ -> server/ -> clients`.
 *
 * This test exists because the tree had already drifted into a *cycle* —
 * `server/` imported both `cli/` and `tui/`, and `tui/` imported `cli/` —
 * while every doc described a one-way boundary. Only `core/` held its
 * invariant, and it held it by luck rather than by check. A refactor that
 * untangles this without a test to pin it just gets re-tangled by the next
 * convenient import.
 *
 * Two tiers, because they are fixed at different times:
 *
 * 1. **Direction** — nothing may import upward. `core/` imports no client
 *    and no server; `server/` imports no client; the two clients never
 *    import each other. `tui/ -> server/` and `cli/ -> server/` are the
 *    intended edges.
 * 2. **Depth** — a client may reach into `core/` only for the shared
 *    kernel: the vocabulary and OS primitives listed below. Every domain
 *    *operation* goes through `ClientApi`.
 *
 * Both tiers carry an allowlist of the violations that existed when the
 * test was written. The allowlists only ever shrink: an entry that no
 * longer fires is itself a failure, so finishing a migration forces the
 * bookkeeping instead of leaving dead exceptions behind.

 * The shared kernel: what a client may import from `core/` directly.

 * client may name a thread's type, decode a provider summary, label a
 * runtime mode, or shell out to the OS — none of that drives anything.
 * It may not open the store, start a turn, resolve a project or build a
 * live provider catalog; those go through `ClientApi`.
 *
 * `catalog/summary` and `catalog/permissions` are in here because they are
 * the vocabulary all three layers speak — that is exactly why they moved
 * down out of `cli/`. `catalog/selection` (how flags and config resolve to
 * a model) and `threads/views` (what "busy" or "settled" means for a
 * thread envelope) and `threads/longthreads` (when a long thread hands
 * off or compacts) are pure rules over values a client already holds —
 * no store, no drivers — so a client may apply them to what `ClientApi`
 * returned. `catalog/direct` is *not*: it probes live providers, so it is
 * an operation. `core/syntax` is the vendored tree-sitter grammars plus
 * their loader: data and registration shared by every presentation client
 * (the TUI today, the desktop next), not a domain operation, so clients
 * may import it directly.
