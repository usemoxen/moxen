/**
 * Telling a parent thread its delegated tasks finished.
 *
 * Without this a parent had to poll `task_status` (or run the orchestrate
 * skill's signal-file listener) to learn a child was done. Now the process
 * that runs the child sends the parent one message when it settles — a
 * steer into the parent's running turn where the provider takes one, else a
 * turn of its own. Tasks settling within a moment of each other share one
 * message, so a fan-out does not wake the parent once per child.
 *
 * The message carries the facts twice: as text the model reads, and as
 * structured `notification` data the TUI draws as a card.
