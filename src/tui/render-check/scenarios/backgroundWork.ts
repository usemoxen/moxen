/**
 * Background work (`run_in_background` commands, Monitor watches,
 * background subagents): the live set surfaces as a composer footer segment
 * ("1 shell"), and the palette offers both a "View background tasks" row
 * (opens the browser) and a direct per-task stop row. Both go away once the
 * provider reports the set empty.
 *
 * The footer segment opens the side panel's Background tab; a row there
 * opens the browser (list -> details -> back -> closed). Not from the
 * palette row: swapping one open picker for a
 * different modal type from inside its own row handler doesn't repaint in
 * this harness (the "Rename thread" row has the same gap). Every modal step
 * waits out ModalShell's fade-in, and every bare ESC the parser's
 * escape-sequence timeout, before capturing.
