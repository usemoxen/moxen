 * Boot gate: the app renders its loading screen until the shell snapshot has
 * landed (thread list, projects) and — once launch-selection has picked a
 * thread — that thread's own snapshot has landed too. `openThreadId === null`
 * with threads present is the transient render between shell sync and the
 * pick: NOT ready (latching there would skip the transcript leg and flash
 * the chrome). Only an empty workspace is ready with no thread picked — it
 * routes to the creating view and nothing will ever be picked. Resyncs reset
 * `synchronized` to false via `emptyThreadState()`, so the predicate drops
 * again mid-session — `App` latches it for boot and only the transcript pane
 * re-gates afterwards, never the whole app.
 *
 * `providersReady`: the provider catalog and the plan usage have been read (or
 * failed to be). The composer's footer depends on them (model names, the usage
 * gauges, which layout it takes), so the first frame waits for them rather than
 * redraw when they land.
