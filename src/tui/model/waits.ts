 * Time a turn spent waiting on the user rather than working.
 *
 * A turn that parks on a question or a permission prompt is not working
 * while it waits: the provider has stopped and nothing happens until the
 * user answers. Counting that as "Worked for 20m" misreports the turn —
 * and the live clock ticking on while the answer panel sits open reads as
 * the agent being busy when it is the user it is waiting on.
 *
 * Each wait is bracketed by a pair of ledger rows sharing a `requestId`:
 * `user-input.requested` → `user-input.resolved` for agent questions, and
 * `permission.requested` → `permission.resolved` for tool approvals. A
 * wait with no closing row is still open.
