# CLI reference

The same binary scripts everything the TUI does, with stable `--json`
envelopes (`{ "ok": true, "data": ... }`) for automation. Every command
supports human-readable output. `--json` produces `{ "ok": true, "data": ... }`
on success and a stable error envelope on failure.

## Handover

Hands the current folder or Git repository to a new thread. It resolves the workspace against the local project registry, optionally creates the missing project, creates a fresh thread, and starts its first prompt against the selected provider driver:

```bash
moxen handover --prompt "Continue the implementation from this handover."
moxen handover --prompt-file handover.txt --open none
printf '%s' "$PROMPT" | moxen handover --stdin
```

| Flag | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `--prompt`, `--prompt-file`, `--stdin` | Exactly one is required |
| `--open` | `auto`, `desktop`, `browser`, `none` |
| `--provider` | A provider instance id from `providers list` (`claudeAgent`, `opencode/<provider>`) |
| `--model` | A model slug supported by that provider instance |
| `--speed`, `--speed-mode` | `standard`, `fast` |
| `--thinking-effort` | A model-supported value such as `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` or `max` |
| `--permission`, `--runtime-mode` | `approval-required`, `auto-accept-edits`, `auto`, `full-access` |
| `--mode`, `--interaction-mode` | `build`/`default`, `plan` |
| `--checkout`, `--env-mode` | `current`/`local`, `worktree`, or the resolved default via `auto` |

Command flags override the CLI config, which overrides the project's saved model selection. Without either override, the saved selection and its options are passed through unchanged. A newly-created project has no default; the fallback is the explicit installation default (`codex` / `gpt-5.4`).

Speed and thinking effort are stored as model options. The provider driver applies the option ids supported by the selected provider/model. If `--provider` changes the project's default provider instance, also pass `--model` because provider instance ids can be user-defined and do not imply a model.

## Existing threads

List threads across projects, or restrict discovery by project id or workspace:

```bash
moxen threads list
moxen threads list --status active --cwd .
moxen threads list --status settled --project <project-id>
moxen threads search webhook retry   # titles, messages, tool calls; settled too, active first
```

`--status` accepts `active`, `settled`, `snoozed`, or `all` (the default). A thread reads as `snoozed` while it is unsettled and its `snoozedUntil` lies in the future. Results include the exact thread id, project, title, model, and update time. Inspect the exact target before sending:

```bash
moxen threads inspect --thread <thread-id>
```

`inspect` returns a bounded preview in JSON: the 6 most recent messages, with message text limited to 2,000 characters, plus `snoozedUntil` when the thread is snoozed. Read a thread projection without truncation:

```bash
moxen threads read --thread <thread-id>
moxen --json threads read --thread <thread-id>
moxen --json threads read --thread <thread-id> --last-turn
moxen --json threads read --thread <thread-id> --view turn-items
moxen --json threads read --thread <thread-id> --view plans
moxen --json threads read --thread <thread-id> --view checkpoints
moxen --json threads read --thread <thread-id> --view transfers
```

`--view` defaults to `messages`: the JSON result stores the transcript in `data.thread.messages`. Messages remain in chronological order and retain their `turnId`. `--last-turn` keeps only messages assigned to `data.thread.latestTurn.turnId`. Neither mode truncates message text. The other views expose the thread's activity ledger (`turn-items`), proposed plans (`plans`, currently always empty — no plan capture is wired yet), and checkpoint summaries (`checkpoints`, backed by git worktree snapshots around each turn); `transfers` is always empty because no transport exposes context-transfer rows.

## Follow-up messages

Send to an existing thread instead of starting a new one. Use the **thread ID** from a previous command's JSON `data.thread.id`. `--thread` and `--thread-id` are aliases:

```bash
moxen threads send --thread <thread-id> --prompt "Run the morning check."
moxen threads send --thread-id <thread-id> --stdin --open none < follow-up.txt
moxen threads send --thread-id <thread-id> --prompt-file follow-up.txt --dry-run
```

Exactly one of `--prompt`, `--prompt-file`, or `--stdin` is required. The message is recorded as a turn on that thread and the provider run continues in the background; success reports acceptance, not agent completion. A failed send never deletes the thread. Archived threads are rejected (there is no unarchive path).

Choose how to handle active work (default `reject`):

```bash
moxen threads send --thread-id <thread-id> --if-busy inject \
  --prompt "Additional context for the work in progress…" --open none
```

- `--if-busy reject` (default) returns `THREAD_BUSY` without recording when the thread has an active or pending turn.
- `--if-busy inject` records immediately even when busy, letting the provider incorporate the prompt into active work. It does not introduce a CLI queue or send an interrupt command.

The busy check holds the per-thread mutex instead of a snapshot preflight: one active turn per thread is enforced, not raced. Success reports acceptance rather than agent completion.

Sending to a settled thread requires confirmation. Non-interactive and JSON callers must explicitly opt in with `--wake-settled`:

```bash
printf '%s' "New findings that require more work..." \
  | moxen --json threads send --thread <thread-id> --stdin --wake-settled
```

The turn keeps the thread's model, permission, and mode unless overridden. `--provider`, `--model`, `--speed`, and `--thinking-effort` override the model for that turn only (global `provider`/`model` config is ignored so a stale default cannot flip a scheduled thread's model). There is no `--permission`/`--mode` flag: change the thread's modes in the TUI permission picker, since scheduled runs inherit them.

`--delivery` selects follow-up policy (default `auto`; every follow-up is recorded as a `thread.turn.start` turn, so the mode governs preconditions and reporting): `queue` records even when busy and reports `queued`, `steer` requires an active turn and reports `steered`, and `restart` interrupts the active turn first and reports `restarted` (`THREAD_NOT_STEERABLE` when idle). `--handoff-note <text>` records provider-switch context as CLI-side metadata without changing the recorded turn.

Use `--prompt-file` (or `--stdin`) for skill invocations and longer prompts, `--open none` for headless runs, and `--dry-run --json` to inspect the turn command without dispatching it.

Manage settlement explicitly without starting a new turn:

```bash
moxen threads settle --thread <thread-id>
moxen threads unsettle --thread <thread-id>
```

`settle` refuses a thread with a running session or a pending approval or user-input request. `unsettle` marks the thread manually active but does not send a message or start its provider session. Both apply synchronously to the ledger.

Snooze an active thread until an ISO-8601 datetime, interrupt an active turn, or delegate a sub-agent task to a child thread in the same project:

```bash
moxen threads snooze --thread <thread-id> --until 2030-01-01T00:00:00.000Z
moxen threads unsnooze --thread <thread-id>
moxen threads interrupt --thread <thread-id> [--run <turn-id>]
moxen threads delegate --thread <parent-id> --prompt "Self-contained task" --open none
moxen threads task-status --thread <parent-id> --task <child-thread-id>
moxen threads task-cancel --thread <parent-id> --task <child-thread-id>
```

`delegate` sends only the task prompt as the child's first turn and waits for its latest turn to reach `completed`, `interrupted`, or `error` (default budget 600000ms via `--timeout-ms`; `--no-wait` returns after acceptance). A wait timeout exits 0 with `data.task.waitTimedOut: true` and never cancels the child — re-poll with `task-status`. `task-cancel` interrupts the live provider run through the store and marks the turn interrupted.

Thread targeting uses exit code `3` for a missing target and `4` for a lifecycle/confirmation refusal.

To run a message on a schedule (for example daily at 05:01), pair it with the OS scheduler. The provider CLIs must be installed and authenticated, and the machine awake. The scheduler doesn't load your shell profile, so point it at `bun` and the script path directly rather than at the `moxen` function/alias. PowerShell example:

```powershell
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "bun.exe" `
  -Argument '"C:\absolute\path\to\moxen\src\cli\index.ts" --json threads send --thread <thread-id> --prompt-file "<path-to-prompt.txt>" --open none'
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At 05:01
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "Moxen 5am thread ping" -Action $action -Trigger $trigger
```

macOS/Linux equivalent (cron):

```bash
1 5 * * * bun /absolute/path/to/moxen/src/cli/index.ts --json threads send --thread <thread-id> --prompt-file "<path-to-prompt.txt>" --open none
```

## Settings

```bash
moxen config show
moxen config set projectPolicy existing
moxen config set workspaceMode folder
moxen config set openMode browser
moxen config set threadEnvMode local
moxen config set provider opencode/openai
moxen config set model gpt-5.4
moxen config set speedMode fast
moxen config set thinkingEffort xhigh
```

| Setting | Values | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `projectPolicy` | `create`, `existing` | `create` |
| `workspaceMode` | `repo`, `folder` | `repo` |
| `openMode` | `auto`, `desktop`, `browser`, `none` | `auto` |
| `threadEnvMode` | `auto`, `local`, `worktree` | `auto` |
| `runtimeMode` | `approval-required`, `auto-accept-edits`, `auto`, `full-access` | `full-access` |
| `interactionMode` | `default`, `plan` | `default` |
| `provider` | Provider instance id for model overrides | Unset (inherits thread/project) |
| `model` | Model slug for overrides | Unset (inherits thread/project) |
| `speedMode` | `standard`, `fast` | Unset (inherits thread/project) |
| `thinkingEffort` | Model-supported effort value | Unset (inherits thread/project) |

`projectPolicy: "existing"` makes a missing project a hard error. `workspaceMode: "folder"` uses the exact current folder instead of walking up to the Git root. `threadEnvMode: "auto"` follows project → `moxen.json` → global local/worktree preference. Explicit CLI config values remain overrides.

`--checkout worktree` provisions a local worktree for the new thread: a `moxen/<id>` branch off the current branch (or its origin — new worktrees always start from origin), placed under the store's `worktrees` directory, with the thread rooted there. A repository without a current branch returns `WORKTREE_REQUIRES_BRANCH` instead of silently falling back to the current checkout.

### MCP servers

MCP servers declared under `mcpServers` are added to every provider session, alongside whatever
the provider's own config already loads. The shape is the one `.mcp.json` uses; edit the config
file directly (`moxen config path`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fs": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "some-mcp"], "env": { "ROOT": "/work" } },
    "docs": { "type": "http", "url": "https://docs.example/mcp", "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer …" } }
  }
}
```

A project's `moxen.json` can declare `mcpServers` too: an entry replaces the global one of the
same name, and `null` removes it for that project. Servers are read when a session starts, so an
edit applies to the next session. Names may use letters, digits, `-` and `_`. `config show` redacts `env` and `headers`
values.

## Providers, models, and efforts

`providers list`, `models list`, and `efforts list` probe live sources on every call with no server in the loop: `claudeAgent` from its bundled catalog, and one `opencode` instance carrying the whole models.dev catalog (slugs are `provider/model`, matching migrated threads) plus local API-key presence and stored OAuth state. Use them to pick valid `--provider`, `--model`, and `--thinking-effort` values before a handover instead of guessing — unknown ids fail with `PROVIDER_NOT_FOUND` / `MODEL_NOT_FOUND` and list what exists. Choices marked `*` in human output are the model's defaults.

`models hide` / `models show` curate the pickers: hidden models stay usable when named explicitly and stay visible on threads already running them — they only leave the model picker lists.

`models list` never reports `hidden` on this backend — there is no picker-preference store yet, so everything reads visible.

`providers list` reports each instance's `usageLimits` as `null`: subscription-quota windows are session-live in every native driver and there is no session to probe at listing time. Per-turn token totals are recorded in the turn ledger as runs settle and feed the TUI usage display.

## Opening threads

`--open` is accepted everywhere for script compatibility, but there is no desktop app to deep-link into: `opened.kind` is always `none`. The TUI (`moxen tui`) is the interactive interface; use `--open none` for headless runs.
