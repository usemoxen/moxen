# Work with Moxen threads

Use `moxen` for all commands. For the normal hand-off flow, use the `moxen-handoff` skill
instead.

The commands below work on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Examples show bash for macOS/Linux and
PowerShell for Windows.

On Windows, prefer `--prompt-file` over a piped `--stdin`. PowerShell 5.1 silently turns
non-ASCII characters into `?` on a piped prompt, and still reports `ok: true`. PowerShell 5.1 runs
when something calls `powershell` instead of `pwsh`. `--prompt-file` skips the shell, so it works
the same on both platforms.

## Start a new thread explicitly

`handover` resolves and creates the project from `--cwd` in one call. Use `threads create` when
the project is already resolved, or when you must set policy and thread controls by hand.

Pass the prompt over stdin or `--prompt-file`. This avoids shell quoting and command-length
problems:

```bash
printf '%s' "$PROMPT" | moxen --json threads create --stdin
```

```powershell
moxen --json threads create --prompt-file <path-to-prompt.txt>
```

Give exactly one of `--prompt`, `--prompt-file`, or `--stdin`. Set thread controls with
`--provider`, `--model`, `--speed`, `--thinking-effort`, `--permission`, `--mode build|plan`, and
`--checkout current|worktree`, when needed.

By default, the thread inherits the project's full saved model selection, including
provider-specific options. Flags and CLI config override this. If the project has no saved
selection, the CLI falls back to the provider's own default model. The default permission is
full access (`full-access`). Use `--project-policy existing` when
you cannot create a project. Use `--dry-run --open none` to inspect the proposed command without
changing any state.

## Discover and read existing threads

First find candidates in the right project. Then inspect the exact target id before you change it:

```bash
moxen --json threads list --cwd . --status all
moxen --json threads inspect --thread "$TARGET_THREAD_ID"
```

`--status` accepts `active`, `settled`, `snoozed`, or `all` (the default). A thread counts as
`snoozed` while it is unsettled and its `snoozedUntil` is in the future. An expired snooze reads
back as `active`. Use `--project <project-id>` instead of `--cwd` when you have the exact project
id. Do not pick a target by title alone — titles are not unique.

`inspect` gives a short preview: the 6 most recent messages, with each message capped at 2,000
characters. It also reports `snoozedUntil` (`null` when the thread is not snoozed). Use `read` for
the full conversation:

```bash
moxen --json threads read --thread "$TARGET_THREAD_ID"
moxen --json threads read --thread "$TARGET_THREAD_ID" --last-turn
moxen --json threads read --thread "$TARGET_THREAD_ID" --view turn-items
moxen --json threads read --thread "$TARGET_THREAD_ID" --view plans
moxen --json threads read --thread "$TARGET_THREAD_ID" --view checkpoints
moxen --json threads read --thread "$TARGET_THREAD_ID" --view transfers
```

`--view` defaults to `messages`. This returns every message, with no text truncated. Read
`data.thread.messages` in order. Each message keeps its `turnId`. A user message that is waiting to
start a turn can have a `null` turnId. `--last-turn` keeps only messages whose `turnId` matches
`data.thread.latestTurn.turnId` (this also filters the `turn-items` view; other views ignore it).
`turn-items` gives the thread's V1 activity log. `plans` gives its proposed plans. `checkpoints`
gives its checkpoint summaries. `transfers` is always empty, because V1 has no context-transfer
rows — this view only documents that fact.

## Message an existing thread

```bash
printf '%s' "$MESSAGE" | moxen --json threads send --thread <thread-id> --stdin --open none
```

```powershell
moxen --json threads send --thread <thread-id> --prompt-file <path-to-message.txt> --open none
```

`--thread` and `--thread-id` are aliases. Give exactly one of `--prompt`, `--prompt-file`, or
`--stdin`. The send dispatches `thread.turn.start`, and waits until the message appears in the thread's
projection before it reports success. A failed send never deletes the thread. `THREAD_NOT_FOUND`
and `THREAD_ARCHIVED` are explicit errors.

A busy thread rejects the send by default, with `THREAD_BUSY`. Pass `--if-busy inject` only when
you are authorized to interrupt active work. A settled thread needs interactive confirmation, or
`--wake-settled`. JSON and stdin workflows are non-interactive, so use `--wake-settled` only when
waking that thread is authorized. An archived thread cannot receive a turn.

The turn inherits the thread's model, permission, and mode. `--provider`, `--model`, `--speed`,
and `--thinking-effort` override the model for that one turn only — the global `provider`/`model`
config is ignored here. There is no `--permission` or `--mode` flag for a send. Validate scheduled
payloads with `--dry-run` first. Moxen must be running when the scheduled command fires.

`--delivery` sets the client-side follow-up policy. The default is `auto`. V1 always dispatches
`thread.turn.start`; the delivery mode changes the preconditions and the report, not the wire
shape:

```bash
moxen --json threads send --thread <thread-id> --stdin --open none --delivery queue < follow-up.txt
moxen --json threads send --thread <thread-id> --prompt "Steer toward tests" --delivery steer --open none
moxen --json threads send --thread <thread-id> --prompt "Restart with logs" --delivery restart --open none
```

PowerShell has no `<` input-redirection operator; use `--prompt-file` there instead:

```powershell
moxen --json threads send --thread <thread-id> --prompt-file follow-up.txt --open none --delivery queue
moxen --json threads send --thread <thread-id> --prompt "Steer toward tests" --delivery steer --open none
moxen --json threads send --thread <thread-id> --prompt "Restart with logs" --delivery restart --open none
```

- `auto`: the default behavior. A busy thread rejects with `THREAD_BUSY`, unless you pass
  `--if-busy inject`.
- `queue`: dispatches even when busy. Reports `data.delivery: "queued"` (or `"started"` when idle).
- `steer`: needs an active turn (`THREAD_NOT_STEERABLE` otherwise). Reports `"steered"`.
- `restart`: needs an active turn. Dispatches `thread.turn.interrupt` first, then the new turn.
  Reports `"restarted"`. A failed interrupt aborts with `THREAD_RESTART_FAILED` and sends nothing.

`--handoff-note <text>` records provider-switch context as CLI-side metadata (`data.handoffNote`).
V1 sends no context-transfer row, so the dispatched turn does not change — confirm the note in the
JSON result.

Require `data.verification.accepted: true`. Record `data.message.messageId`.
`THREAD_TURN_NOT_VERIFIED` means the dispatch returned, but verification timed out. Do not retry
automatically — the first message may still appear later. The same rule applies to
`THREAD_SNOOZE_NOT_VERIFIED`, `THREAD_UNSNOOZE_NOT_VERIFIED`, and `THREAD_INTERRUPT_NOT_VERIFIED`.

## Park or re-activate a thread

```bash
moxen --json threads settle --thread "$TARGET_THREAD_ID"
moxen --json threads unsettle --thread "$TARGET_THREAD_ID"
```

Settle a thread only after you are authorized to change its lifecycle. Settlement is refused while
a session is starting or running, or while the thread has a blocking approval or user-input request
(`THREAD_SETTLE_BLOCKED`). Unsettling marks the thread manually active. It does not send a message
or start its provider session.

Both commands need the server to advertise the `threadSettlement` capability
(`THREAD_SETTLEMENT_UNSUPPORTED` otherwise). Both wait for the new lifecycle state to appear in
the store before they succeed. Require `data.verification.accepted: true`.
`THREAD_SETTLEMENT_NOT_VERIFIED` means dispatch returned, but verification timed out — do not
retry automatically.

## Snooze a thread, then wake it

```bash
moxen --json threads snooze --thread "$TARGET_THREAD_ID" --until 2030-01-01T00:00:00.000Z
moxen --json threads unsnooze --thread "$TARGET_THREAD_ID"
```

Snooze sits on top of the active lifecycle. The thread stays active in the lifecycle model. It is only
hidden from the inbox until `--until` (a valid ISO-8601 datetime) passes. Both commands verify the
projection before they succeed. Require `data.verification.accepted: true`.
`THREAD_SNOOZE_NOT_VERIFIED` and `THREAD_UNSNOOZE_NOT_VERIFIED` mean dispatch returned, but the
change never appeared — do not retry automatically. Archived threads are rejected.

## Interrupt an active turn

```bash
moxen --json threads interrupt --thread "$TARGET_THREAD_ID"
moxen --json threads interrupt --thread "$TARGET_THREAD_ID" --run "$TURN_ID"
```

This dispatches V1 `thread.turn.interrupt` (with a `turnId` only when you pass `--run`), and waits
for the interruption to appear in the projection. A thread with no active turn returns
`data.result: "no_active_run"` and dispatches nothing. Require `data.verification.accepted: true`
when an interrupt dispatches. `THREAD_INTERRUPT_NOT_VERIFIED` and `THREAD_INTERRUPT_FAILED` both
mean the turn was left alone — do not retry automatically.

## Delegate a sub-agent task, poll it, cancel it

Delegation is done with the `moxen` MCP tools, which every top-level Moxen session has loaded —
not with the CLI. The child is an ordinary Moxen thread, in a git worktree of its own by default.

- `models` — the providers, models and efforts you can delegate to, with each provider's usage.
- `delegate` — `task` (everything the child needs: it sees none of your conversation), and
  optionally `title`, `provider`, `model`, `effort`, `isolation` (`worktree` | `shared`), `fork`.
  Returns at once with a `taskId`.
- `task_status` — `taskId`, and `waitMs` (up to 45 000). Reports `running`, or the final report and
  the branch holding the work.
- `task_cancel` — `taskId`. Stops a running task; its thread and worktree are kept.

You do not poll: when a task settles, Moxen writes a `<task-notification>` into your thread. Load
the `moxen-orchestrate` skill when one delegation grows into a planned multi-task effort — per-task
model selection, fan-out with merging, adversarial checks, cost-aware routing. Do not build that by
hand from these primitives.

Delegated threads do not get these tools: a child cannot delegate or hand off further.
